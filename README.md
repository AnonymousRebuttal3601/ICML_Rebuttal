Here, we present new experimental results along with a more intuitive description of the datasets.

# 1. Re-experimentation on Baselines With and Without Structural Constraint Module

We have included new graphs regarding the experimental results of baselines with and without structural constraint module, with dashed lines representing MDGS performance under different conditions.

# 3. Illustration of Different Forms of Complex Rotational Body Utilized in The Experiments

As demonstrated in the figure, we affix the hinge to a central object and apply a rotational torque to test its state of rotation, as well as to assess the state of rotation after the hinge has been actuated.

From the figure, it can be observed that we have constructed a mechanical structure vehicle, with the tires connected to the chassis using bearings. Subsequently, we conducted tests on it under various environmental conditions and configurations.

# 5. The Experimental Visualization Results on The Vehicle Dataset

From the visualization results, it can be observed that MDGS provides more accurate predictions of vehicle trajectory, owing to its better understanding of the intricate mechanical interactions and interplay forces within the vehicle.

# 6. The Experimental Visualization Results on The Cubli Robot (Three Flywheels) Dataset

From the visualization results, it is evident that MDGS provides more accurate trajectory predictions for the Cubli robot. An interesting observation is that baseline methods, due to their inability to capture internal interactions within the mechanical body effectively, neglect the influence of reaction wheels, resulting in significant deviations in attitude predictions for the Cubli robot.
